# Improper Integrals

In defining the Riemann integral {{<katex>}}\int_{a}^{b}{{</katex>}}f(x)dx
 the interval [a,b] of integration is finite and f (x)
is finite at every point in [a,b] . In many physical applications, the following types of integrals arise:
f x dx
where a is a real number and f (x) is a continuous function on the interval of integration. They are
defined as the limits of Riemann integrals as follows:
