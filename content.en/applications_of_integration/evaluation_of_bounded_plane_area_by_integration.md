# Evaluation of a Bounded Plane Area by Integration
In the beginning of this chapter, we have already introduced definite integral by a geometrical approach. In that approach, we have noted that, whenever the integrand of the definite integral is non-negative, the definite integral yields the geometrical area. In the present section, we apply the approach for finding areas of plane regions bounded by plane curves.

# Area of the region bounded by a curve, x – axis and the lines x = a and x = b.
Let y = f (x), a  x  b be the equation of the portion of the continuous curve that lies above the x − axis (that is, the portion lies either in the first quadrant or in the second quadrant) between the lines x = a and x = b . See Fig.9.8. Then, y ≥ 0 for every point of the portion of the curve. Consider the region bounded by the curve,x − axis, the ordinates x = a and x = b . It is important to note that y does not change its sign in the region. Then, the area A of the region is found as follows Viewing in the positive direction of the y − axis, divide the region into elementary vertical strips (thin rectangles) of height y and width Dx . Then, A is the limit sum of the areas of the vertical strips.
