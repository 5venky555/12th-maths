# 9.6 Reduction Formulae

Certain definite integrals can be evaluated by an index-reduction method. In this section,
we obtain the values of the following definite integrals:
sinnx dx
0
2

 , cosnx dx
0
2

 , sinmx nx dx
0
2

 cos , xm x n dx
0
1
 (1− ) .
We also obtain the value of the improper integral e− xxn dx  0 .
The method of obtaining a reduction formula has the following steps:
Step 1 : Identify an index (positive integer) n in the integral.
Step 2 : Put the integral as In .
Step 3 : Applying integration by parts, obtain the equation for In in terms of In−1or In−2 .
The resulting equation is called the reduction formula for In .
We list below a few reduction formulae without proof:
