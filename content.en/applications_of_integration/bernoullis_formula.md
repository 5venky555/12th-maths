# Bernoulli’s Formula

The evaluation of an indefinite integral of the form {{<katex>}}\int_{a}^{b}{{</katex>}}u(x)v(x)dx becomes very simple, when u is a polynomial function of x (that is, u(x)=
 can be easily integrated successively. It is accomplished by a formula called Bernoulli’s formula. This formula is actually an extension of the formula of integration by parts. To derive the formula, we use the following notation:
