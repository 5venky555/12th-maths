# Different forms of Equation of a plane

We have already seen the notion of a plane.

Definition 6.8

A vector which is perpendicular to a plane is called a normal to the plane.

Note
Every normal to a plane is perpendicular to every straight line lying on the plane.
A plane is uniquely fixed if any one of the following is given:
- a unit normal to the plane and the distance of the plane from the origin
- a point of the plane and a normal to the plane
- three non-collinear points of the plane
- a point of the plane and two non-parallel lines or non-parallel vectors which are parallel to the plane
- two distinct points of the plane and a straight line or non-zero vector parallel to the plane but    not     parallel to the line joining the two points.

Let us find the vector and Cartesian equations of planes using the above situations.
