# Scalar Product and Vector Product

Next we recall the scalar product and vector product of two vectors as follows.

# Definition 6.1

     Given two vectors 
     
     
     ={{< katex >}}a_1\hat{i}+a_2\hat{j}+a_3\hat{k}{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}} \vec{b}=b_1\hat{i}+b_2\hat{j}+b_3\hat{k}{{< /katex >}} the scalar product (or dot product) is denoted by {{< katex >}}\vec{a}\cdot \vec{b}=a_1b_1+a2_b2+a_3b_3,{{< /katex >}} and is calculated by and the vector product (or cross product) is denoted by {{< katex >}}\vec{a}\times \vec{b}{{< /katex >}} , and is calculated by

     {{< katex >}}\vec{a}\times \vec{b}{{< /katex >}} =
