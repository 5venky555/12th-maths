# “Mathematics is the science of the connection of magnitudes.
Magnitude is anything that can be put equal or unequal to another thing.
Two things are equal when in every assertion each may be replaced by the other.”
— Hermann Günther Grassmann

# Introduction

We are familiar with the concept of vectors, (vectus in Latin means “to
carry”) from our XI standard text book. Further the modern version of Theory
of Vectors arises from the ideas of Wessel(1745-1818) and Argand (1768-1822)
when they attempt to describe the complex numbers geometrically as a directed
line segment in a coordinate plane. We have seen that a vector has magnitude
and direction and two vectors with same magnitude and direction regardless
of positions of their initial points are always equal.

We also have studied addition of two vectors, scalar multiplication
of vectors, dot product, and cross product by denoting an arbitrary vector by
the notation {{< katex >}} \vec{a} \space or \space a_1 \hat{i} + a_2 \hat{j} + a_3 \hat{k}{{< /katex >}}. To understand the direction and magnitude of a given vector and
all other concepts with a little more rigor, we shall recall the geometric introduction of vectors, which
will be useful to discuss the equations of straight lines and planes. Great mathematicians Grassmann,
Hamilton, Clifford and Gibbs were pioneers to introduce the dot and cross products of vectors.
The vector algebra has a few direct applications in physics and it has a lot of applications along
with vector calculus in physics, engineering, and medicine. Some of them are mentioned below.


- To calculate the volume of a parallelepiped, the scalar triple product is used.
- To find the work done and torque in mechanics, the dot and cross products are respectiveluy used.
- To introduce curl and divergence of vectors, vector algebra is used along with calculus. Curl
and divergence are very much used in the study of electromagnetism, hydrodynamics, blood
flow, rocket launching, and the path of a satellite.
- To calculate the distance between two aircrafts in the space and the angle between their paths,
the dot and cross products are used.
- To install the solar panels by carefully considering the tilt of the roof, and the direction of the
Sun so that it generates more solar power, a simple application of dot product of vectors is
used. One can calculate the amount of solar power generated by a solar panel by using vector
algebra.
- To measure angles and distance between the panels in the satellites, in the construction of
networks of pipes in various industries, and, in calculating angles and distance between
beams and structures in civil engineering, vector algebra is used.
