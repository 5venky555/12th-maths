# Application of Vectors to 3-Dimensional Geometry

Vectors provide an elegant approach to study straight lines and planes in three dimension. All
straight lines and planes are subsets of {{< katex >}}R^{3}{{< /katex >}}. For brevity, we shall call a straight line simply as line.A plane is a surface which is understood as a set P of points in {{< katex >}}R^{3}{{< /katex >}} such that , if A B, , and C are any three non-collinear points of P , then the line passing through any two of them is a subset of P.Two planes are said to be intersecting if they have at least one point in common and at least one point which lies on one plane but not on the other. Two planes are said to be coincident if they have exactly the same points. Two planes are said to be parallel but not coincident if they have no point in common. Similarly, a straight line can be understood as the set of points common to two intersecting planes. In this section, we obtain vector and Cartesian equations of straight line and plane by applying vector methods. By a vector form of equation of a geometrical object, we mean an equation which is satisfied by the position vector of every point of the object. The equation may be a vector equation or a scalar equation.

# Different forms of equation of a straight line

A straight line can be uniquely fixed if
- a point on the straight line and the direction of the straight line are given
- two points on the straight line are given
We find equations of a straight line in vector and Cartesian form.To find the equation of a straight line
in vector form, an arbitrary point P with position vector {{< katex >}}\vec{r}{{< /katex >}}
on the straight line is taken and a relation satisfied by {{< katex >}}\vec{r}{{< /katex >}}
is obtained by using the given conditions. This relation is called the vector equation of the
straight line. A vector equation of a straight line may or may not involve parameters. If a vector equation
involves parameters, then it is called a vector equation in parametric form. If no parameter is involved,
then the equation is called a vector equation in non â€“ parametric form.

# A point on the straight line and the direction of the straight line are given

(a) Parametric form of vector equation

Theorem 6.11

The vector equation of a straight line passing through a fixed point with position vector {{< katex >}}\vec{a}{{< /katex >}} and parallel to a given vector {{< katex >}}\vec{b}{{< /katex >}} is {{< katex >}}\vec{r}{{< /katex >}} ={{< katex >}}\vec{a}{{< /katex >}} +{{< katex >}}\vec{tb}{{< /katex >}}, where t {{< katex >}}\epsilon R{{< /katex >}} .

Proof

If {{< katex >}}\vec{a}{{< /katex >}} is the position vector of a given point A and {{< katex >}}\vec{r}{{< /katex >}} is the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the straight line, then
{{< katex >}}\vec{AP}{{< /katex >}} = {{< katex >}}\vec{r}-\vec{a}{{< /katex >}} .

Since {{< katex >}}\vec{AP}{{< /katex >}} is parallel to {{< katex >}}\vec{b}{{< /katex >}}, we have

{{< katex >}}\vec{r}-\vec{a}{{< /katex >}} = {{< katex >}}tb, t\epsilon R{{< /katex >}}      ... (1)
or 
{{< katex >}}\vec{r}{{< /katex >}} ={{< katex >}}\vec{a}{{< /katex >}} + tb, {{< katex >}} t\epsilon R{{< /katex >}}
