# Applications of First Order Ordinary Differential Equations
The subject of differential equations has vast applications in solving real world problems. The solutions of the differential equations are used to predict the behaviors of the system at a future time,
or at an unknown location. In several problems, the rate at which a quantity changes is a given function of the quantity and /or the time. The objective is to find the quantity itself. If x denotes the amount of the quantity present at time.

In solving differential equations, separation of variables was introduced initially by Leibniz and later it was formulated by John Bernoulli in the year 1694.

We give below some relations between the rate of change and unknown functions that occur in
real life situations.

(a)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is directly proportional to y :

{{< katex >}}\frac{dy}{dx}= ky.{{< /katex >}}

 (b)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is directly proportional to the product of {{< katex >}}^{y2}{{< /katex >}} and x :

 {{< katex >}}\frac{dy}{dx}=^{ky2x.}{{< /katex >}}

  (c)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is inversely proportional to y :

{{< katex >}}\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{k}{y}.{{< /katex >}}

 (d)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is directly proportional to {{< katex >}}^{y2}{{< /katex >}}  and inversely
proportional to {{< katex >}}\sqrt{x}{{< /katex >}} :

{{< katex >}}\frac{dy}{dx}=\tfrac{y2}{\sqrt{x}}.{{< /katex >}}

A differential equation is an equation in which some derivatives of the unknown function occur.
 In many cases the independent variable is taken to be time. 

 In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or “real life” problem, we must formulate
the problem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a mathematical model for the problem.
Many physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since rates of change
are represented mathematically by derivatives, mathematical models often involve equations relating
to an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. Such equations are differential equations.
They are of basic significance in science and engineering since many physical laws as well as
relations are modelled in the form of differential equations. Differential equations are much useful
in describing mathematical models involving population growth or radio-active decay. The study of
biological sciences and economics is incomplete without the application of differential equations.

 The subject of differential equations was invented along with calculus by
Newton and Leibniz in order to solve problems in geometry and physics. It
played a crucial part in the development of Newtonian physics by the Bernoulli
family, Euler, and others. Some of the applications of differential equations
in our daily life are found in mobile phones, motor cars, air flights, weather
forecast, internet, health care, or in many other daily activities.

In this chapter, we introduce and discuss the first order ordinary differential
equations and some methods to find their solutions.

• apply differential equation in real life problems

(i) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≤ r if and only if −r ≤ x − a ≤ r if and only if x ∈ [a − r, a + r].
 
(ii) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≥ r is equivalent to x − a ≤ −r or x − a ≥ r if and only if
x ∈ (−∞, a − r] ∪ [a + r, ∞).

In solving differential equations, separation of variables was introduced initially by Leibniz and
later it was formulated by John Bernoulli in the year 1694.

A first order differential equation is separable if it can be written as h y( ) y g ′ = ( ) x where the left side is a product of y′ and a function of y and the right side is a function of x .

If a differential equation is not expressible to polynomial equation form having the highest order derivative as the leading term then that the degree of the differential equation is not defined.

The determination of the degree of a given differential equation can be tricky if you are not well versed with the conditions under which the degree of the differential equation is defined. So go through the given solved examples carefully and master the technique of calculating the degree of the given differential equation just by sheer inspection.
