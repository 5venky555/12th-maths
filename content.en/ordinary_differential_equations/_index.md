   # Ordinary Differential Equations

Motivation and Early Developments
Just we look at some real life situations where 
	 ●	 the motion of projectile, rocket, satellite and planets
	 ●	 the charge or current in the electric circuit
	 ●	 the conduction of heat on a rod or in a slab
	 ●	 the vibrations of a wire or membrane etc
are to be determined.Themathematicalformulations ofsuch problems emerge as differential equations
under certain scientific laws. These laws involve various rates of change (derivatives) of one or more
quantities with respect to other quantities. Thusthe scientific laws manifest as mathematical equations
involving derivatives, viz. differential equations. 
	 Differential Equations emanate from the problems in geometry, mechanics, physics, chemistry,
and engineering studies. We have studied about “rates” in our early classes. This is also known as
instantaneous rate of change which is denoted as dy/dx.
We give below some relations between the rate of change and unknown functions that occur in real life situations.
	 (a)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is directly proportional to y :
 dy
dx = ky .
	 (b)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is directly proportional to the product of y
2 and x :
 dy
dx = ky x
2 .
	 (c)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is inversely proportional to y :
 dy
dx = k
y .
	 (d)	 The rate of change of y with respect to x is directly proportional to y
2 and inversely
proportional to x :
 dy
dx = k y
x
2
.
A differential equation is an equation in which some derivatives of the unknown function occur.
	 In many cases the independent variable is taken to be time.
     In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or “real life” problem, we must formulate
the problem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a mathematical model for the problem.
Many physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since rates of change
are represented mathematically by derivatives, mathematical models often involve equations relating
to an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. Such equations are differential equations.
They are of basic significance in science and engineering since many physical laws as well as
relations are modelled in the form of differential equations. Differential equations are much useful
in describing mathematical models involving population growth or radio-active decay. The study of
biological sciences and economics is incomplete without the application of differential equations.	 The subject of differential equations was invented along with calculus by
Newton and Leibniz in order to solve problems in geometry and physics. It
played a crucial part in the development of Newtonian physics by the Bernoulli
family, Euler, and others. Some of the applications of differential equations
in our daily life are found in mobile phones, motor cars, air flights, weather
forecast, internet, health care, or in many other daily activities.
	 In this chapter, we introduce and discuss the first order ordinary differential
equations and some methods to find their solutions.
