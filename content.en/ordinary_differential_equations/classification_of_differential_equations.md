# Classification of Differential Equations 

**Definition 10.4: (Ordinary Differential Equation)**

If a differential equation contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more functions with respect to a single independent variable, it is said to be an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE).

**Definition 10.5: (Partial Differential Equation)**

An equation involving only partial derivatives of one or more functions of two or more independent variables is called a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).

For instance, let y denote the unknown function and x be independent variable. Then 
{{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}} +2y=ey, {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}} {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}-5y=0 ,  {{< katex >}} \frac{dy2}{dx2}{{< /katex >}} {{< katex >}} \frac{dy2}{dx2}{{< /katex >}}=3x-4y are some examples of ordinary differential equations.

For instance,{{< katex >}}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial^2u }{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u }{\partial y^2}=0, \frac{\partial^2u }{\partial x^2}=\frac{\partial^2u }{\partial t^2}-2\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}{{< /katex >}} are some examples of partial differential equations.

In this chapter, we discuss ordinary differential equations only.

Ordinary differential equations are classified into two different categories namely linear ordinary differential equations and nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

**Definition 10.6**

A general linear ordinary differential equation of order n is any differential equation that can be written in the following form.

(1)	 The important thing to note about linear differential equations is that there are no products of the function, y x( ), and its derivatives and neither the function nor its derivatives occur to any power other than the first power.

(2)	 No transcendental functions – (trigonometric or logarithmic etc) of y or any of its derivatives occur in differential equation.

(3)	 Also note that neither the function nor its derivatives are “inside” another function, for instance, y′ or ey′.

**Definition 10.7**
A nonlinear ordinary differential equation is simply one that is not linear.

(1)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=0 is a differential equation.

(2)	 The equation{{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=sin x is a differential equation

(3)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}+y{{< /katex >}}=7x+y is a differential equation.

(4)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=sin x is a differential equation.

	 
**Definition 10.8**

Here we shall learn to solve inequalities involving absolute values. First we analyze very simple
inequalities such as (i) |x| < r and (ii) |x| > r.
 
(i) Let us prove that |x| < r if and only if −r < x < r. Note that r > 0 as |x| ≥ 0.
There are two possibilities to consider depending on the sign of x.
 
Case (1). If x ≥ 0, then |x| = x, so |x| < r implies x < r.
 
Case (2). If x < 0, then |x| = −x, so |x| < r implies −x < r that is, x > −r.
 
Therefore we have, |x| < r if and only if −r < x < r, that is x ∈ (−r, r).
Any other solution is nontrivial. In fact this is true for a general linear homogeneous differential equation as well.

**Definition 10.8**
(i) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≤ r if and only if −r ≤ x − a ≤ r if and only if x ∈ [a − r, a + r].
 
(ii) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≥ r is equivalent to x − a ≤ −r or x − a ≥ r if and only if
x ∈ (−∞, a − r] ∪ [a + r, ∞).

The population will increase whenever the offspring increase Forinstance, let ustake rabbits as our population. More number of rabbits yield more number of baby rabbits. As time increases the population of rabbits increases.
