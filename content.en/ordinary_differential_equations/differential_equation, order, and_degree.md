# Differential Equation, Order, and Degree
Definition 
A differential equation is any equation which contains at least one derivative of an unknown function, either ordinary derivative or partial derivative.

For instance, let y f = ( ) x where y is a dependent variable ( f is an unknown function) and x is an independent variable.

(1)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=0 is a differential equation.

(2)	 The equation{{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=sin x is a differential equation

(3)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}+y{{< /katex >}}=7x+y is a differential equation.

(4)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=sin x is a differential equation.

(5)	 The equation e{{< katex >}} \tfrac{dx}{dy} {{< /katex >}}ln , 0 is a differential equation.

(6)	 The equation {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{dy}{dx}{{< /katex >}}=sin x is a differential equation

**Definition 10.2 (Order of a differential equation)**

The order of a differential equation is the highest order derivative present in the differential equation.

Thus, if the highest order derivative of the unknown function y in the equation is kth derivative,then the order of the differential equation is k. Clearly k must be a positive integer.

For example, {{< katex >}} \frac{dy}{dx}+y{{< /katex >}}=7x+y is a differential equation of order three

**Definition 10.3 (Degree of a differential equation)**


If a differential equation is expressible in a polynomial form, then the integral power of the highest order derivative appears is called the degree of the differential equation

In other words, the degree of a differential equation is the power of the highest order derivative involved in the differential equation when the differential equation (after expressing in polynomial form) satisfies the following conditions :

(i)	All of the derivatives in the equation are free from fractional powers, if any.

(ii)	Highest order derivative should not be an argument of a transcendentalfunction, trigonometric or exponential, etc. The coefficient of any term containing the highest order derivative
should just be a function of x, y, or some lower order derivative but not as transcendental,trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic function of derivatives.

If one or more of the aforementioned conditions are not satisfied by the differential equation, it should be first reduced to the polynomial form in which it satisfies all of the above conditions.

If a differential equation is not expressible to polynomial equation form having the highest order derivative as the leading term then that the degree of the differential equation is not defined.

The determination of the degree of a given differential equation can be tricky if you are not well versed with the conditions under which the degree of the differential equation is defined. So go through the given solved examples carefully and master the technique of calculating the degree of the given differential equation just by sheer inspection!

**Examples for the calculation of degree:**

As we have observed that there is an order preserving one-to-one correspondence between elements
of R and points on the number line. Note that for each x ∈ R, x and −x are equal distance from the
origin. The distance of the number a ∈ R from 0 on the number line is called the absolute value of
the number a and is denoted by |a|. Thus, for any x ∈ R, we have
 
{{< katex >}} |x| = \left \{ x if x \geq 0, -x if x \leq 0.\right. {{< /katex >}}
 
and hence | · | defines a function known as absolute value function, from R onto [0, ∞) and the graph
of this function is discussed in Chapter 1.
 
(i) For any x ∈ R, we have |x| = | − x| and thus, |x| = |y| if and only if x = y or
x = −y.
 
(ii) |x − a| = r if and only if r ≥ 0 and x − a = r or x − a = −r.
 
**Example 10.1**
 
Note that a real number a is said to be a solution of an equation or an inequality, if the statement
obtained after replacing the variable by a is true.
 
Next we shall learn solving equations involving absolute value.
 
 Solve |2x − 17| = 3 for x.
 
Solution:
|2x − 17| = 3. Then, we have 2x − 17 = ±3 which implies x = 10 or x = 7.
 
**Remark:**
 
(i) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≤ r if and only if −r ≤ x − a ≤ r if and only if x ∈ [a − r, a + r].
 
(ii) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≥ r is equivalent to x − a ≤ −r or x − a ≥ r if and only if
x ∈ (−∞, a − r] ∪ [a + r, ∞).
