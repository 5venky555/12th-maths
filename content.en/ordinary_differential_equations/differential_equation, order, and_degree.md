# Differential Equation, Order, and Degree
Definition 
A differential equation is any equation which contains at least one derivative of an unknown
function, either ordinary derivative or partial derivative.
	 For instance, let y f = ( ) x where y is a dependent variable ( f is an unknown function) and x
is an independent variable.
	 (1)	 The equation dy
dx = 0 is a differential equation.
	 (2)	 The equation dy
dx = sin x is a differential equation
(3)	 The equation dy

Definition 10.2 (Order of a differential equation) 
The order of a differential equation is the highest order derivative present in the differential
equation.
	 Thus, if the highest order derivative of the unknown function y in the equation is kth derivative,
then the order of the differential equation is k. Clearly k must be a positive integer.
	 For example, d y

Definition 10.3 (Degree of a differential equation)
If a differential equation is expressible in a polynomial form, then the integral power of the
highest order derivative appears is called the degree of the differential equation
	 In other words, the degree of a differential equation is the power of the highest order derivative
involved in the differential equation when the differential equation (after expressing in polynomial
form) satisfies the following conditions :
	 (i)	All of the derivatives in the equation are free from fractional powers, if any.
	 (ii)	Highest order derivative should not be an argument of a transcendentalfunction, trigonometric
or exponential, etc. The coefficient of any term containing the highest order derivative
should just be a function of x, y, or some lower order derivative but not as transcendental,
trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic function of derivatives.
	 If one or more of the aforementioned conditions are not satisfied by the differential equation, it
should be first reduced to the polynomial form in which it satisfies all of the above conditions.
If a differential equation is not expressible to polynomial equation form having the highest 
order derivative as the leading term then that the degree of the differential equation is not 
defined. 
	 The determination of the degree of a given differential equation can be tricky if you are not
well versed with the conditions under which the degree of the differential equation is defined. So go
through the given solved examples carefully and master the technique of calculating the degree of the
given differential equation just by sheer inspection
